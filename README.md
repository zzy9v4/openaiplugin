This plugin allows developers to easily generate code using OpenAI's GPT-3 technology, directly from within the Eclipse IDE.
appo

## Requirements
- OpenAI API Secret Key
- Eclipse 4.17 or later
- Java 8 or later

## Installation
- Download the plugin from the update site
- Install the plugin in your Eclipse installation

## Features
- Generate code from text selections in your editor, whether it be method descriptions or javadocs
- Multiple text selections are supported, allowing you to generate code for multiple items at once
- Activation through resource context menu or shortcut 
- Choose from multiple models, with text-davinci-003 as the default
- Set the maximum number of tokens to use for each code generation request, with a default of 2000

## Usage
- Select a piece of text in your editor
- Right click and select "OpenAI Code Generator" in the resource context menu

## Note
- The OpenAI API key is encrypted before being saved in the Eclipse preferences store for security reasons.
- The plugin uses the AES algorithm for encrypting the API key.

- On the first use of the plugin, the OpenAI API key will need to be entered in the preferences page.

## Known Issues
- Formatting of generated code may not always be perfect
- Large amount of text may cause the plugin to slow down
